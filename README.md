This repo is my portfolio and  will contain projects from the 'The Odin Project' and
'freeCodeCamp' curriculi.

-Sep. 29 2021-
First project will be a landing page from TOP. 
Languages: HTML and CSS.

-Oct. 05 2021- There are other challenge sources incoming. For now it's the 'Frontend Mentor' challenges. 
Trying to get even more comfortable with laying out pages and adding style to them.
